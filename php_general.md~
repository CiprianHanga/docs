## PHP General


### PHP CLI vs PHP CGI

- PHP can be installed via:

```bash
$ sudo zypper install php7
```

- this command installs the CLI (Command Line Interface) version, which doesn't process GET/POST data -- it's sort of a clean PHP interpreter, completely unaware of HTTP
- this command is identical to:

```bash
$ sudo zypper install php7-cli
```

- for web development purposes, one needs to install the CGI version:

```bash
$ sudo zypper install php7-cgi
```

- if the php7-cgi package is not available, install the php7 version and then install the suggested packages:

```

### Visual Studio Code

- go to File... Preference... Workspace Settings... and add this line in the settings.json file: ```"php.validate.executablePath": "/usr/bin/php"
	- *Note:* be mindful about the .json files rules -- that entries must be separated by a ```,```, but if it's the last line, it shouldn't have any punctuation
- for Windows systems the setting should be ```"php.validate.executablePath": "c:\\xampp\\php\\php.exe"
