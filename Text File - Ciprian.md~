## Some Linux annoyances

### After distro upgrade, X won't start

#### Temporary Solution:

- in the boot screen, choose Advanced options
- choose the last: boot from a previous snapshot
- choose one (I chosed the oldest, first one after install)
- if successfull, when logged in open a root term and type:

```bash
snapper rollback
shutdown -r now
```

- the system will reboot and (hopefully) get into the new snapshot as default
- Note: the apps installed after that snapshot will need to be installed again (it will preserve the settings though)
- maybe rolling back to a more recent snapshot should be a better solution?

### gvim
- colors are in ```/usr/share/vim/vim74/colors/```
- vimrc file should be in Home, as a ```.vimrc``` file
    - if for some reasons it does not seem to work, edit it with:
```bash
:e $MYVIMRC
```

    - you can check the path with ```Ctrl + G```

- check all the loaded files with ```:scriptnames```

I don't think the labeling ("OCD") is even correct for what you are implying, but even if it were, I'm sick of people making all sorts of excuses for being lazy slobs. Those that are neat are considered "obsessive", "control freaks", and so on, while the most disgusting and messy individuals pride themselves as being "creative", "non-conformists" and all those other shitty excuses for being unorganised, messy, unreliable, distracted, and so on.

Being neat and keeping things in check requires will power and self discipline, while being messy and pretending to be "creative" is a poor excuse for being downright lazy (and most likely unproductive).

When I was younger I was very disorganized and surrounded by lots of clutter that almost drove me insane, so I had to make a change. It was the best thing I did for myself, and I can testify for the peace of mind that is giving you, also for the self growth that comes from teaching yourself to be disciplined and follow the system that you created for yourself. That takes time and patience. It's not like you follow a "three step program" and you're done. The hard part is making those three steps a part of your daily routine. That isn't the easiest thing to do. It's HARD. It requires WORK. As they say, if it were easy, everybody would do it. But they don't, and it's no wonder why.

Compulsive behavior has nothing to do with it. On the contrary, being organized takes a lot of discipline and commitment. Most of the time, you have to push yourself to do it (esp in the beginning).

(I realised you were just trolling, so don't bother replying. These are just some thought I felt like writing.)

### mplayer

- search for the mvp package with YaST2
    - also get the smvp package (frontend for MVP)

### qt (needed for various packages, and good to have for development anyway)

- go to http://wiki.qt.io/
- choose your install method from list (for me: Install Qt5 on OpenSUSE)
- follow the steps

- add the repo from http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Qt5/<choose your release>

### install from a .run file

- download the .run file (with browser or wget)
- run these:
```bash
$ chmod +x file.run
$ ./file.run
```
### install Dropbox

- search for dropbox OpenSUSE link
- download the .ymp file
- double-click on the file
- install by YaST2
- run the command: ```$ dropbox start -L```
- after the ```Done!``` message you're all set
